## Usage

To fly the ship forward, press the up arrow. To change the direction of the ship, use the left and right arrows. Fire the laser by pressing the space bar. The object of the game is to fly around the screen and destroy all the asteroids. Each asteroid will split into 2 smaller asteroids. Each of the smaller asteroids can be split into 2 smallest asteroids. Once all the smallest asteroids are destroyed, the game levels up by adding more starting asteroids and increasing their speed slightly. The player has 3 lives, displayed in the top left of the screen. Each time the ship collides with an asteroid, one life is lost. The player's score is displayed in the top right of the screen. High scores are saved in localStorage and are displayed at the top of the screen.
